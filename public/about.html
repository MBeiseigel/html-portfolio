<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hi, my name is Melissa! I am a small animal veterinarian that recently decided to pursue web development. 
  I have been a veterinarian since 2017, and have loved helping families keep their fur babies healthy. While 
  there are many things about being a veterinarian that brought me joy, I have always felt that my natural 
  skill set would be more effective in another line of work. My organizational skills, attention to detail, 
  love for designing things, and a desire to maintain efficiency all led me to dip my feet into coding (that, and some 
  encouragement from my amazing husband).</p>

<p>I am married to my husband, Cameron, who is the real brains in our family. We have two small boys that are going to 
  be just as smart as him one day (someone help me).</p>
